A sponsored post will be in the "Sponsored" category, you can identify it at the beginning of a post, here is an [sponsored post template]().

## What is the difference between a regular post and a sponsored post?
The content is created by me as always. The only difference is that the client chooses the subject which I am going to write about it.

## How can I sponsor a post?
If you enjoy the way I share my experiences and my thoughts, please, considering email me at renan.andradefranca@gmail.com or Direct Message (DM) me on Twitter  [@renan_afranca](https://www.twitter.com/renan_afranca) (follow me and I will follow you back to unlock the DM option) with the subject/product/tool that you would like me to write about.
### How much it will cost?
It will cost 100 dollars.

After the subject was chosen I charged $50,00 before starting to write the blog post. When I finished writing the post and sent the draft you will only pay the remaining $50,00 only if you enjoy it.
