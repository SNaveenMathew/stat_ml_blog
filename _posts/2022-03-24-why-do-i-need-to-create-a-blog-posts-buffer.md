I am going to stop blogging weekly before I failed. I am going to explain why.

Since I started blogging (last monthüòÖ, I am a beginner) I have been using exclusively my phone to write my blog posts because I had to take care of my baby girl. That's leading me to create the following interesting post:

* [VSCode on Android (you don‚Äôt need to install anything)](https://renanfranca.github.io/2022/03/02/vscode-on-android.html)

Then I realized that you enjoyed the objective content and it's getting better if there is a short screen capture video showing how to. Here is another blog post with a short video:

* [Create a Github stunning profile üí´ (by dynamically listing your recent blog posts)](https://renanfranca.github.io/2022/03/17/create-a-github-stunning-profile.html)

As [InHuOfficial](https://twitter.com/InHuOfficial) said in his [blog post](https://dev.to/inhuofficial/it-is-possible-to-get-a-voice-here-tips-to-grow-on-devto-a-mini-rant-27n6):

> It is much better to release an article regularly every 2 or 4 weeks than it is to release sporadically (I should know, I was guilty of this).
People quickly pick up on patterns, even subconsciously, so if you post at a certain time at a regular interval people will start anticipating your articles.
> 

I am carefully trying to say that I am not going to vanish ü•¥! But I don't know yet the interval that I am going to publish the next articles.

## Why now?

### Post quality

I will need to screen capture my notebook for the following posts, so I will need more time to make it happens.

### Opportunities

Some opportunities appear because I am blogging. So I need more free time to grab those opportunities and see what is going to happen üòÜ. 

Last week I participated at Twitter Space hosted by [@TheSohini](https://twitter.com/TheSohini) and [@avdev4j](https://twitter.com/avdev4j)

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The recording <a href="https://t.co/ZuVLPC4Y6I">https://t.co/ZuVLPC4Y6I</a><br><br>At the end I talked about my recently experience with the <a href="https://twitter.com/jhipster?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@jhipster</a> project and how I am sharing it on my blog <a href="https://t.co/KAA1n9yMvU">https://t.co/KAA1n9yMvU</a></p>&mdash; Renan Franca (@renan_afranca) <a href="https://twitter.com/renan_afranca/status/1504833377144291341?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 18, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I didn't expect talk in the end and after the space [@avdev4j](https://twitter.com/avdev4j) said that want to elaborate something to we do together. Until now I didn't talk to him about that ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, but I will be available now üòâ

### Reading & Engaging

I have 90 articles pending to read and join the discussion. How am I going to write if I don't have time to read, sometimes interesting subjects appear even in the discussion section.

## Buffer my posts

My first blog post was on Tuesday, the next week was on Wednesday, then Thursday and now on Friday. It is crystal clear that I couldn't keep up this pace.

So I decided that before I come back to publish again I am going to build up a buffer. I don't know if I will buffer 3 or 5 blog posts before publishing again.

I do know that with that buffer I won't feel the pressure to create another post immediately.
