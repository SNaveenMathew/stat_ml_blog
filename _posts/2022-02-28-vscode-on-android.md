Since my baby girl was born I don't have the time to use my computer because I'm taking care of her and I only have a short period of free time during the day. So I needed to use my Android smartphone to create and update [my blog](https://renanfranca.github.io?utm_source=dev.to&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=promote-blog).

When you click on the JHipster link at my blog home page, It will open the JHipster site into a new tab:

If you have a repository at github, you can access the [VsCode web](https://github.dev) version by replacing the **.com** with **.dev**. 

After that, your github repository will be opened with a VsCode web version and each commit automatically push the change to de repository.

As an example of the use VsCode on Android I will remove the target _blank from the JHipster link at home:

Change my blog repository using VsCode on fullscreen

Once the repository was changed, [the github action](https://dev.to/entando/get-started-with-github-actions-1gde) will automatically publish my blog update and the JHipster link will open at the same tab:

I used vscode to easily navigate through my repository files, I used the search/replace, change files folder and rename. It helped me a lot!

In my opinion, VsCode for Android isn't a smooth experience and it's hard to hit the spot you want to change at code.
