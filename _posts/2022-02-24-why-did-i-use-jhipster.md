## Why did I use JHipster?

I have been thinking that we type a lot of boilerplate code demanded by the technology before the business logic code.

Even though, as a backend developer, using Spring Boot Annotation, Lombok and maven archetype project doesn't completely solve this issue. Why didn't we already automate the development process itself?

After some research I found JHipster! Explain JHipster..

I use JHipster because I am tired of:

• Create/Type entity classes

• Create/Type Repository, Services and Controllers classes with CRUD code

• Create integration test for CRUD operation 

• Create DTO classes


• Create Mapper classes

• Configure liquibase

• Configure Security

• Configure spring application yml for each environment
 
 • Database connection 

 • Spring profiles

 • Set framework/library properties

• Manually keep spring boot and the project dependencies updated

• Create yml files to deploy on Kubernetes
