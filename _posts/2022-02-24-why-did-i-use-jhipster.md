## Why did I use JHipster?

I have been thinking that we type a lot of boilerplate code demanded by the technology before the business logic code.

Even though, as a backend developer, using Spring Boot Annotation, Lombok and maven archetype project doesn't completely solve this issue. Why didn't we already automate the development process itself?

After some research I found JHipster wich is a rapid application development plataform for java web applications and microservices.

### Some of the JHipster options:

â€¢ Generate simple monolith web applications

â€¢ Generate complete microservice architecture

â€¢ Generate domain model (entities)

â€¢ Generate Continuous Integration (CI)/Continuous Deployment (CD) pipelines

â€¢ Deploy to the cloud or containers

### I am using JHipster because I am tired of:

â€¢ Create/Type entity classes

â€¢ Create/Type Repository, Services and Controllers classes with CRUD code

â€¢ Create integration test for CRUD operation 

â€¢ Create DTO classes

â€¢ Create Mapper classes

â€¢ Configure liquibase

â€¢ Configure Security

â€¢ Configure spring application yml for each environment
 
  * Database connection 

  * Spring profiles

  * Set framework/library properties

â€¢ Manually keep spring boot and the project dependencies updated

â€¢ Create yml files to deploy on Kubernetes
